# TODO: Complete the ArcEager algorithm class.
# 1. Implement the 'oracle' function and auxiliary functions to determine the correct parser actions.
#    Note: The SHIFT action is already implemented as an example.
#    Additional Note: The 'create_initial_state()', 'final_state()', and 'gold_arcs()' functions are already implemented.
# 2. Use the 'oracle' function in ArcEager to generate all training samples, creating a dataset for training the neural model.
# 3. Utilize the same 'oracle' function to generate development samples for model tuning and evaluation.

# TODO: Implement the 'state_to_feats' function in the Sample class.
# This function should convert the current parser state into a list of features for use by the neural model classifier.

# TODO: Define and implement the neural model in the 'model.py' module.
# 1. Train the model on the generated training dataset.
# 2. Evaluate the model's performance using the development dataset.
# 3. Conduct inference on the test set with the trained model.
# 4. Save the parsing results of the test set in CoNLLU format for further analysis.

# TODO: Utilize the 'postprocessor' module (already implemented).
# 1. Read the output saved in the CoNLLU file and address any issues with ill-formed trees.
# 2. Specify the file path: path = "<YOUR_PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILE>"
# 3. Process the file: trees = postprocessor.postprocess(path)
# 4. Save the processed trees to a new output file.
