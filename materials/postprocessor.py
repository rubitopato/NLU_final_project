    """
    A class for post-processing syntactic trees parsed from CoNLL-U formatted files.

    This class provides functionality to correct trees that have issues such as 
    multiple roots or tokens without an assigned head. It ensures that each tree 
    conforms to a standard structure with a single root and all tokens having 
    an assigned head.

    Methods:
        postprocess: Corrects the trees in a given CoNLL-U file and returns the corrected trees.

        Post-processes the syntactic trees from a CoNLL-U file to correct structural issues.

        This method reads a CoNLL-U file, identifies and corrects trees with multiple roots 
        or tokens without an assigned head. It ensures each tree has a single root, and 
        all tokens have a designated head. Tokens without a head are assigned to the 
        root of their respective trees.

        Args:
            path (str): The file path of the CoNLL-U file to be processed.

        Returns:
            list: A list of corrected syntactic trees.
