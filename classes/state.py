class State(object):
    """
    Class to represent a parsing state in dependency parsing.

    Attributes:
        S (list['Token']): A stack holding tokens that are 
                           currently being processed.
        B (list['Token']): A buffer holding tokens that are yet 
                           to be processed.
        A (set[tuple]): A set of arcs of the form (head_id, dependency_label, dependent_id) 
                        created during parsing, representing the dependencies.

    The class is used in dependency parsing algorithms to maintain the state of the parsing 
    process, including which tokens are being considered and the relationships formed between tokens.
