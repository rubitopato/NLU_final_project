class ParserMLP:
    """
    A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) class for a dependency parser, using TensorFlow and Keras.

    This class implements a neural network model designed to predict transitions in a dependency 
    parser. It utilizes the Keras Functional API, which is more suited for multi-task learning scenarios 
    like this one. The network is trained to map parsing states to transition actions, facilitating 
    the parsing process in natural language processing tasks.

    Attributes:
        word_emb_dim (int): Dimensionality of the word embeddings. Defaults to 100.
        hidden_dim (int): Dimension of the hidden layer in the neural network. Defaults to 64.
        epochs (int): Number of training epochs. Defaults to 1.
        batch_size (int): Size of the batches used in training. Defaults to 64.

    Methods:
        train(training_samples, dev_samples): Trains the MLP model using the provided training and 
            development samples. It maps these samples to IDs that can be processed by an embedding 
            layer and then calls the Keras compile and fit functions.

        evaluate(samples): Evaluates the performance of the model on a given set of samples. The 
            method aims to assess the accuracy in predicting both the transition and dependency types, 
            with expected accuracies ranging between 75% and 85%.

        run(sents): Processes a list of sentences (tokens) using the trained model to perform dependency 
            parsing. This method implements the vertical processing of sentences to predict parser 
            transitions for each token.

        Feel free to add other parameters and functions you might need to create your model
